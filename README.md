## C++ Engine Developer  

<br>

Current opus is Wyvern, a 3D Game Engine focusing on (homebrew) cross-compatibility and easy of use. "write once, run everywhere"  
Occasionally doing some small projects, most often system or platform related stuff, like [template-based C++ reflection](https://github.com/ArgoreOfficial/Reflection) or a [PlayStation 1 premake script](https://github.com/ArgoreOfficial/PSn00bSDK-Premake).

I wish to branch out my platform knowledge in the future, having only developed for Windows, Web (Emscripten), and PlayStation 5. Wyvern is one such project.
